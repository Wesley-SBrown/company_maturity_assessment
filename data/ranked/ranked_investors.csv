He has also been the CEO & Co-Founder of Kumu Networks from 2012 to 2014. Prof. Katti's has made groundbreaking research along with his graduate students which shows that it is practically possible to design and implement in-band full duplex radios (i.e. radios that can transmit and receive at the same time on the same frequency). The research has been published in ACM SIGCOMM 2013. The team has designed new algorithms and circuits and demonstrated working prototype implementations of Wi-Fi and LTE in-band full duplex radios, a feat that was hitherto considered impossible. This invention has the potential to revolutionize wireless network design and spectrum allocation. At the simplest level, it cuts the amount of spectrum needed by half. The worldwide value of cellular spectrum used to operate broadband 4G networks is estimated at several trillion dollars. With full duplex, the amount of spectrum needed is cut by half, potentially creating value worth trillions of dollars for society. Prof. Katti has made significant progress in commercializing this technology and bringing it to practice. Along with his students, he has started a company, Kumu Networks that is building the world's first commercial full duplex radios. Kumu has raised $25 million in venture capital investment and is in advanced commercial trials with major operators around the world to bring full duplex technology to practice.
